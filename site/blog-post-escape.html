                <p>According to NASA the MAVEN spacecraft, now circling the RED PLANET, has completed its commissioning activities on November 16, 2014 and has formally begun its one-year primary science mission. This includes the adjusting of the orbit, deploying the booms that hold a number of the instruments away from the spacecraft, ejecting the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) instrument cover, turning on and checking out each of the science instruments, and carrying out calibration activities for both the spacecraft and the instruments.</p>
                <p>During its science mission, the spacecraft will carry out regular observations of the Martian upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and solar-wind interactions. MAVEN will observe from an elliptical orbit that gets as low as about 150 km above the surface and as high as 6000 km. The nine science instruments will observe the energy from the Sun that hits Mars, the response of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, and the way that the interactions lead to loss of gas from the top of the atmosphere to space. The goal is to understand the processes by which gas escape to space occurs, and to learn enough to be able to extrapolate backwards in time and determine the total amount of gas lost to space over time. This will help understand why the Martian climate changed over time, from an early warmer and wetter environment to the cold, dry planet we see today. The MAVEN team consists of researchers at the University of Colorado, NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center, University of California at Berkeley, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as scientists at numerous other institutions who participated in developing the flight hardware and in doing the science analysis. Space exploration is a "team sport", and the success of the whole team allows us to do our science.</p>
