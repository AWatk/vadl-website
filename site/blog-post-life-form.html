					 <p>While we have yet to find signs of life on Mars, the recent discovery of water in the soil of Mars has many people excited, and with good reason. Earlier this year, NASAâ€™s Curiosity rover determined that about 2 percent of the soil on the surface of Mars is composed of water. This means that one cubic meter of martian soil could yield roughly 33 liters of water: enough water to keep one person hydrated for two weeks! Having a local source of water could be instrumental in allowing humans to one day set foot on the red planet; it would be a shame to make the trip (which currently takes more than half a year) only to die of dehydration. While we might not yet be ready to send an astronaut to Mars, it is helpful to know more about the planet and its history so that we might better understand our solar system and prepare for one day making that landing.</p>
					 <p>So how exactly did the Mars rover make these discoveries? By heating the soil to above the boiling point of most common elements and compounds, the Curiosity is able to analyze the gases that boil out and determine what exactly the soil it is testing is made from. As it turns out, not only did we find water in the soil, we also found several carbon-based compounds. As you may already know, almost all life on Earth is based on carbon. With both water and carbon on its surface, the chances of life having once existing on the red planet start to become realistic. This is further supported by the research suggesting that Mars once had an atmosphere similar in composition to that of Earth. Do you believe that there was once life on Mars? There are many theories about past, present, and future life on Mars but the truth is still uncertain.</p>
